### **_Agenda Items:_**
Discuss the parameters and rules of the simulations and the notes from the team leaders meeting on 29/01/21.

### **_Discussion:_**
We first discussed the team leaders meeting notes and decided Jack would take back the REST interface idea and propose we use WebSockets or something similar as the turn based simulation justifies a two way connection better than a request based system. 
We proposed a system where the WHO has a budget which increases based on the severity of the virus. If the virus is spreading quickly and is dangerous then the WHO gets a higher budget to deploy actions faster, but if the virus is spreading slowly the WHO gets a smaller budget. The budget will be used for the WHOs actions such as imposing restrictions and creating testing centres and vaccine development. 

### **_Agenda for Next Meeting:_**

Jack will discuss the points raised in the next team leaders meeting after which we will start on our proposal of the design.
